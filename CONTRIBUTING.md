# Contributing to Page Numbering Addon

We are more than grateful for your willingness to contribute to this extension. There are many ways to take part in the development:
* Localize the different parts of the extension (UI, Help pages, License and extension description).
  
  While there is a [wiki page](https://gitlab.com/lo_extensions/lo-page-numbering/wikis/Localization-tutorial) describing every bit required for the localization of this extension, I am currently developing an l10n utility for LO extensions. This tool, as well as thorough instructions about its usage, can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/lo_extensions/l10n-utility).
  Please consult the corresponding wiki [page](https://github.com/arvchristos/lo-page-numbering/wiki/Using-the-l10n-utility).
* Report bugs and issues.
* Suggest new functionality to be implemented
* Test new implementations from test branches
* Fix any of the open issues

*You should remember to push changes to a seperate branch with descriptive naming in order to maintain an organized repository structure for future reference.*
